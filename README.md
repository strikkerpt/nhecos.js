Nhecos.js
=========

This is a dependency that will generate a random nhecos on any image.

## Installation

### NPM

```bash
npm install --save nhecos.js
```

### Usage

In order to generate a nhecos you must pass your target image into the class by doing the follow:

```javascript
var nhecos = new Nhecos('IMAGE HERE');
```

The class will return a promise with a base64 that you can use wherever you like, check the example below:

```javascript
nhecos.then(function(base64) {
  document.getElementsByClassName('thumbnail')[0].setAttribute('src', base64);
})
```

### Options

Options will be added soon! For now this is a MVP.
